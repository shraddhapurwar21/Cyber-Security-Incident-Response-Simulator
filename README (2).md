# Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulator
**ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

The Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulator is designed to help organizations detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real time. It integrates AWS CloudWatch, Grafana, and a custom web application to monitor logs, identify suspicious activities, and take necessary security actions.

**Features**

- Live Log Monitoring â€“ Captures logs from AWS-hosted websites using CloudWatch.

- Rule-Based Threat Detection â€“ Identifies failed logins, DDoS attempts, and suspicious traffic.

- Grafana Dashboard â€“ Visualizes security events and alerts in real-time.

- Incident Response Actions â€“ Block IPs, restart servers, and take necessary security steps via the web application.

- Incident Playbooks â€“ Documented response plans for various attack scenarios.

**ðŸ“Š How It Works**

1. Website logs are collected via AWS CloudWatch.

2. Grafana fetches and visualizes real-time logs.

3. Logs are identified (failed logins, suspicious patterns).

4. Generate Alerts & Notify Admins (Real-time alerts on threats)

5. Admins take action (block IPs, isolate servers, analyze reports).
